This repository is to manage the current and former versions for the Circles v2 whitepaper. There is a simple workflow in place that anybody with write access can trigger to redeploy a version on whitepaper.aboutcircles.com. 

This workflow gets triggered whenever changes to current-version.txt are pushed. In that file, the path (from root dir) should be added and will be deployed. This also creates transparency about the current file.

Everywhere else references to the whitepaper should always point to whitepaper.aboutcircles.com
